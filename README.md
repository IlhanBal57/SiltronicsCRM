# SiltronicsCRM

During my internship, I developed a full-stack web application for a company called Silter, designed to
streamline all business operations within a single platform (www.siltronics.net)

-Developed user-friendly interface: Designed and implemented a platform for managing products and
companies, allowing users to view, edit, and delete data easily.

-Implemented user management and role-based access control: Created a robust authorization system that
assigns specific permissions to users, enabling administrators to manage and adjust roles.

-Built authentication and activity tracking system: Developed login/logout functionality with detailed activity
logging for security and auditing purposes.

-Created admin dashboard: Provided administrators with a dashboard to monitor system activity, user
interactions, and manage the overall platform.

-Database design and management: Designed and optimized the database for efficient data storage,
retrieval, and overall performance.

-Testing, debugging, and deployment: Conducted testing and debugging to ensure full functionality before
deploying the platform to production for real-world use.
